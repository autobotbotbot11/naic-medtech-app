# NAIC Medtech AI Handoff

## Purpose
This document explains the core product concept for the NAIC Medtech app so another AI can continue implementation without re-discovering the domain context.

## Project Summary
The client is a clinic/laboratory that needs an internal app to make laboratory operations faster during daily use.

The app has two big functional directions:

1. Input
Staff fills up examination forms inside the app, saves records, and uses structured data instead of manually encoding results into scattered templates.

2. Output
The app should eventually generate patient-facing printable results. Legacy print templates exist and can be used as visual guidance, but they are not the strict source of truth.

## Most Important Product Decision
The app must not be built as a fixed set of hardcoded forms.

The highest-priority feature is an `Exam/Form Builder` so the client can:
- create new exams/forms
- edit existing exams/forms
- change fields, sections, and options
- avoid paying a programmer for every future form change

This means the product should be treated as a:

`schema-driven laboratory platform with an exam builder`

not as a:

`lab app with hardcoded forms`

## Phase 1 Priority
Phase 1 must focus on the `Exam/Form Builder`.

Phase 1 should enable:
- creating an exam/form definition
- editing an exam/form definition
- adding sections
- adding fields
- defining choices/options
- defining normal values and unit hints
- reordering fields
- previewing the resulting form structure
- saving the schema definition

Phase 1 is not primarily about:
- user accounts
- full admin portal
- advanced permissions
- broader reporting modules
- full clinic operations suite

Those can come later, but the architecture should still allow them.

## Builder V2 Note
The current builder prototype is not yet considered user-friendly enough for the real client.

Before continuing major builder UI work, read:
- `docs/handoff/BUILDER_V2_PLAN.md`

That document is the active UX/product direction for the next builder implementation pass.

## Current Builder Progress
Current implementation status:
- `Phase 1` shell rebuild is done
- `Phase 2` core editing simplification is in place for the current builder direction
- `Phase 3` drag-and-drop ordering is now implemented

What is already true in the current builder:
- form library is now a collapsible left drawer
- preview is now a toggleable right drawer
- the main canvas focuses on one form at a time
- form setup collapses by default on existing forms
- top-of-form fields are collapsible
- sections are collapsible
- only one section stays open at a time for calmer editing
- fields now use a calmer `Edit` / `Done` flow instead of exposing every field editor at once
- sections and fields now use a calmer `More` action menu instead of always showing all actions
- the save note is now separated into its own save step card
- sections can be reordered by drag-and-drop
- fields can be reordered by drag-and-drop
- `SortableJS` is now used locally for reliable drag-and-drop ordering
- a floating save/reset dock appears while the draft is dirty
- the builder warns before discarding unsaved changes on form switch or page unload

What is still not done:
- final reduction of section-level button noise
- deeper visual polish for truly client-ready comfort
- full stabilization and real-use QA

## Source Of Truth
Primary source of truth:
- `artifacts/schema/naic_medtech_app_schema.json`

Derived from:
- `data/source/NAIC MEDTECH SYSTEM DATA.xlsx`

Supporting references:
- `artifacts/schema/naic_medtech_structure.json`
- `artifacts/schema/naic_medtech_tree_diagram.html`

Legacy print/layout guidance only:
- `references/print-templates/*.dotx`

If there is a conflict:
- schema wins for structure and fields
- legacy print templates only guide presentation and print style

## Product Philosophy
The system should be built on strong reusable primitives instead of unlimited freeform layout editing.

Target:
- flexible enough that the client can build most future exams without a programmer
- structured enough that saving, validating, previewing, and printing remain consistent

Avoid trying to support totally arbitrary desktop-publishing behavior in Phase 1.

## Builder Requirements
The builder should support these structural primitives:
- group/category
- form/exam
- section
- field
- field group
- option list
- display order
- normal value
- unit hint
- notes/instructions

Recommended field controls and data types:
- `input/text`
- `input/textarea`
- `input/number`
- `input/date`
- `input/time`
- `input/datetime`
- `select`
- `multi_select`
- `field_group`
- repeatable rows/table, if needed later

The builder should also support:
- duplicating an existing exam/form
- versioning forms so old patient records remain valid
- previewing the data-entry form
- later mapping the same schema to printable output

## Core Technical Direction
The app should have three clearly separated layers:

1. Exam definition
- schema metadata describing the form

2. Data entry rendering
- UI generated from schema

3. Output rendering
- printable result document generated from schema and record data

Do not tightly couple output layout to a single fixed hardcoded screen.

## Current Domain Structure
Client-approved current groups:
- Clinical Microscopy
- Blood Chemistry
- Serology
- Blood Bank
- Blood Gas Analysis
- Hematology
- Microbiology

Current important rule:
- `COVID 19 Antigen (Rapid Test)` belongs under `Serology`

## Current Important Schema Decisions
These decisions already exist in the current schema and should not be casually undone:

1. Shared patient/request fields were moved into a reusable common field set.
Included examples:
- Name
- Age
- Sex
- Date / Date-Time
- Requesting Physician
- Room
- Case Number
- Medical Technologist
- Pathologist

2. `Blood Bank > Type of Crossmatching > VITAL SIGNS` is normalized as a `field_group`, not a select field.
Its child fields are:
- BLOOD PRESSURE
- PULSE RATE
- RESPIRATORY RATE
- TEMPERATURE

3. In `Blood Chemistry > Male` and `Blood Chemistry > Female`, `IONIZED CALCIUM` must come immediately after `CHLORIDE`.

4. Standalone departments in raw extraction are normalized consistently in the app schema.

## Print Output Guidance
The `references/print-templates` folder contains `.dotx` templates that show the clinic's current print style.

Observed recurring print pattern:
- hospital branding/header
- patient info block
- exam title / department title
- result table or structured result sections
- medtech/pathologist footer

These templates are useful for:
- understanding print tone
- understanding result-document hierarchy
- guiding future PDF/print output styling

They are not the strict implementation source.

## Known Conservative Areas
Some fields in the schema were intentionally left conservative because the workbook did not give enough reliable signal to force a stricter type.

Examples include:
- `TOTAL VOLUME`
- `LIQUEFACTION TIME`
- several `OTHERS` fields
- some Blood Bank phase result fields
- `NOTE` text areas

These should be treated as safe defaults, not as final product truth.

## What Another AI Should Do First
When continuing implementation, the next AI should:

1. Read `artifacts/schema/naic_medtech_app_schema.json`
2. Read `docs/handoff/BUILDER_V2_PLAN.md`
3. Treat the app as schema-driven
4. Build the exam/form builder first
5. Avoid hardcoding individual lab forms
6. Keep output/print generation as a separate later-capable layer

## What Another AI Should Avoid
- Do not build one screen per exam.
- Do not treat legacy `.dotx` templates as the source of truth.
- Do not make the first version depend on programmer-only form changes.
- Do not assume accounts/admin features are the current main milestone.

## Ideal Phase 1 Outcome
By the end of Phase 1, the client should be able to:
- define or edit an exam/form without developer help
- preview the resulting structure
- preserve logical sections and field order
- keep the system ready for future patient-result entry and printable outputs
